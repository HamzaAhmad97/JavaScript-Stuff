# Before You Start

In this repo you will find a number of files explaining/discussing/talking about specific topics like **object oriented programming in JavaScript**, **asynchronous JavaScript** and other things. This includes my own observations and explanations for these topics as I understood them, also, this included collected information from various resources. The aim of this is not sharing for that matters, but in fact the main reason I made this is for me to keep track of how all of these topics really work, you can consider the things discussed as notes in a notebook.
